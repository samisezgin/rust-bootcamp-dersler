## Task Details

Building a Custom Filtering Function in Rust

In this task, you will create a custom filtering function in Rust that allows filtering elements from a given collection based on a specific condition. The goal is to implement a beginner-friendly solution that avoids using closures to simplify the understanding of the code.

### Steps
- Create a new Rust project by running the following command in the terminal:

```cargo new my_project ```

- Open the main.rs file in a text editor.

- Define a struct called FilterCondition with a single field of the desired type for filtering.

- Implement a method called is_match on the FilterCondition struct that takes a reference to an item of the same type as the filter condition and returns a boolean indicating whether the item matches the condition.

- Define a function called custom_filter that takes a collection (e.g., a vector) and a reference to a FilterCondition object as arguments. The function should iterate over the elements in the collection and return a new collection containing only the elements that match the filter condition.

- In the main function, create a collection (e.g., a vector) with some elements and initialize a FilterCondition object with the desired value.

- Call the custom_filter function with the collection and the FilterCondition object, storing the result in a new variable.Print the filtered result to the console.Compile and run the program to test its functionality.




### Checklist

- Create a new Rust project and open the main.rs file.

- Define the FilterCondition struct with the desired type for filtering.

- Implement the is_match method on the FilterCondition struct.

- Define the custom_filter function to filter elements based on the condition.

- Create a collection and a FilterCondition object in the main function.

- Call the custom_filter function and store the result.

- Print the filtered result to the console.

- Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
