## Task Details

Create a simple calculator using enums and pattern matching.

### Steps

- Create an enum called Operation with variants Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. Each variant should hold two f64 values.

- Create a function called calculate that takes an Operation enum as an argument and returns an f64 result.

- Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the variant of the Operation enum.

- In the main function, prompt the user to input the first number, the operation to be performed, and the second number.

- Parse the user input into appropriate variables.

- Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.

- Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.

- Print the result to the console.

- Compile and run the program to ensure it works as expected.



### Checklist

- Define the Operation enum with the appropriate variants and values.

- Write the calculate function signature.

- Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.

- Prompt the user to input the first number, operation, and second number.

- Parse the user input into appropriate variables.

- Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.

- Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.

- Print the result to the console.

- Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
